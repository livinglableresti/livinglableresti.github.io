				<p>We are happy to announce that our Lerești Living Lab has been officially accepted into <a href="https://enoll.org">ENoLL (the European Network of Living Labs)</a>, one of the most important international networks promoting open innovation and real-life experimentation.</p>
				
				<p>Through our Living Lab, we aim to raise awareness of cancer risk factors and prevention, working closely with local communities. Together with citizens, we are co-creating the most suitable preventive policies tailored to the real needs of people living in rural areas. Because citizens are at the very heart of our approach, they actively contribute to the design, testing, and validation of solutions that truly respond to community needs.</p>
				
				<h2>About ENoLL</h2>
				<p>ENoLL is a global network that brings together Living Labs from Europe and beyond to foster user-centered, open innovation ecosystems. Its mission is to facilitate knowledge sharing, collaboration, and capacity building among Living Labs, while supporting the development of sustainable, inclusive, and impactful solutions to societal challenges.</p>
				
				<h2>What This Means for Our Community</h2>
				<p>By joining ENoLL, the Lerești Living Lab becomes part of an animated international community committed to co-creation, citizen engagement, and innovation with real societal impact. This membership will enable us to connect with other Living Labs across Europe, share best practices, and strengthen our approach to community-centered cancer prevention in rural areas.</p>						<hr />
